# [Evan's really cool website]
[The idea is that the website is a "what are your chances of finding a valentine"?
so theres going to be a home page
and there is the option to click a button that takes you to another page
this second page will ask for your relationship status and chosen gender. 
if male and relationship, then 90% chance of valentine
if male and no relationship then 0.01% chance of valentine
if female and relationship 30% chance of valentine
if female and no relationship then 75% chance of valentine
if other (specified) and relationship then 66% chance of valentine
if other (specified) and no relationship then 13% chance of valentine
will include a picture at the end saying good luck through a heart. ]

to operate, there's one button on home page, that will be clicked
then three other buttons (and a text box that does nothing). 
then two other buttons
function with 6 if statements for each possibility
all take you to the same final page with text stating your percentage (and an encouraging message)
there will be an attempt at a picture on the final page
