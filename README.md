# [Evan's really cool website]
[The idea is that the website is a "what are your chances of finding a valentine"?
so theres going to be a home page
and there is the option to click a button that takes you to another page
this second page will ask for your relationship status and chosen gender. 
if male and relationship, then 90% chance of valentine
if male and no relationship then 0.01% chance of valentine
if female and relationship 30% chance of valentine
if female and no relationship then 75% chance of valentine
if other (specified) and relationship then 66% chance of valentine
if other (specified) and no relationship then 13% chance of valentine
will include a picture at the end saying good luck through a heart. ]

to operate, there's one button on home page, that will be clicked
then three other buttons (and a text box that does nothing). 
then two other buttons
function with 6 if statements for each possibility
all take you to the same final page with text stating your percentage (and an encouraging message)
there will be an attempt at a picture on the final page


ok ok revisions: I'm actually reading the assignment now and i see that I need like 5 whole pages
so: 
home page
gender? page
relationship? page
results page
happy valentines day!! page 
all pages will be visited, in that order
calculated result will be completely accurate because my math is perfect and its the way to world works trust
looks like that was the only thing I didnt do 
(I don't remember the practice mentioning forms but after a quick goole search ik what they are)
have no idea what they do, and will trial and error the living shit out of this, but it'll be fun (no it wont i dont like websites)

if youve actually read all this instead of just testing the website literally what are you doing.
